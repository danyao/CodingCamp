# GAME: Piano

This document provides a functional spec for a simple web-based piano game.

# Feature Spec

## User Interface

The main game interface consists of 15 buttons in a row that represent the 15 white keys on a piano for a little over 2 octaves. Each key is labeled with the note letter, i.e. C, D, E, F, G, A, B. Each key has a different colour from the rainbow.

The default colour of each button has low brightness. When pressed, the colour of the button becomes brighter.

## Gameplay

When the user presses on a key, it plays the note of that key.

# Technical Spec

The game should be playable as a local web app without any storage.
